# Chess-Engine-cpp
Designed and implemented a rule-complete chess engine in C++ using object-oriented principles, modeling board state, pieces, moves, and game flow. The engine supports legal move generation, check/checkmate detection, and game termination logic. A graphical interface built with raylib renders the chessboard and pieces, enabling interactive play through mouse input and dynamic visual updates.
